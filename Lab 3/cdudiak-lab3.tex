\section{Explicit Euler}
\begin{verbatim}
def springProp(z, h):
    # loop over the lists simultaneously and compute new values
    for i, (x, v) in enumerate(z):
        if (i + 1 >= N):
            break
        z[i + 1] = (x + h * v, v - h * x)
    return z
\end{verbatim}
This function sets the next values based on the old values. Using this function, the position and velocity are graphed vs time. For this set:
\begin{align*}
	x_0 &= 5.0\\
	v_0 &= 0.0\\
	h &= .01
\end{align*}
Unless otherwise stated. Plotting the propagation of the spring for 2000 steps, we get:

\section{Analytical Solution}
For the analytic solution of $a = {d^2x \over dt^2} = -x$ with the initial conditions above and ${k\over m}  = 1$:
\begin{align*}
	&x(t) = 5.0\cos(t)\\
	&v(t) = -5.0\sin(t)\\
\end{align*}
Plotting the errors we find:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.6]{"errors"}
	\caption{Explicit Evaluation of Euler's Method Errors from Analytic Solution}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier
As time increase, the maximum magnitude of the error in both position and velocity gets larger; this increase in maximum peaks is linear with time.

\section{Truncation Errors}
Using h = .0027, we see the following truncation errors:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.6]{"trunc"}
	\caption{Explicit Evaluation of Euler's Method Truncation Errors on h}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier

As the value of h increases, the maximum error from the analytic solution increases proportionally as well. At extremely small h's, the error is almost 0.

\section{Energy}
Looking at Total Energy $E = v^2 + x^2$ as a function of time:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.6]{"energy"}
	\caption{Explicit Evaluation of Euler's Method Energy}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier
We see that the energy is increasing linearly over time just like the maximum magnitude of the global errors. Eventually, this energy would go to 
infinity rather than remain constant due to the errors in the floating point precision.

\section{Implicit Euler}
Solving the implicit solution, we can find:
\begin{align*}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		x_{i + 1} \\
		v_{i + 1}
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & -h \\
		h & 1
	\end{pmatrix} ^{-1}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		x_{i} \\
		v_{i}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
Using this, we can calculate the global errors and energy as before:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"positionComp"}
	\caption{Implicit and Explicit Euler's Method Position Errors}
\end{figure} 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"velocityComp"}
	\caption{Implicit and Explicit Euler's Method Velocity Errors}
\end{figure} 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"energyComp"}
	\caption{Implicit and Explicit Euler's Method Energy}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier
As we can see, the implicit errors are of the same form but perfectly mirror the explicit errors given that they are calculated from new values rather
than old values. They evolve at the same rate though. The energies however go in opposite directions; the implicit energy tends to negative
infinity rather than positive for the same reason.


\section{Conservation of Energy}
It has been a very busy week so I have not implemented the solutions to these problems, but I will discuss the results. 
\subsection{Implicit and Explicit Phase-Space}
Since the energy is not conserved in the implicit and explicit cases, they will not form complete circles in phase space. The explicit
form, which tends to infinite energy, spirals outward, and the implicit solution, which tends to negative infinity spirals inward.

	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"ephase"}
	\caption{Explicit Phase $v_0 = 0.0, d_0 = 5.0$: Spirals Out}
\end{figure} 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"iphase"}
	\caption{Implicit Phase $v_0 = 0.0, d_0 = 5.0$: Spirals In}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Symplectic Euler}

The Symplectic Euler method uses:
\begin{align*}
	&x_{i+1} = x_i + h v_i\\
	&v_{i+1} = v_i - h x_{i+1}\\
\end{align*}

This is generated by the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
def springSymp(z, h):
    # loop over the lists simultaneously and compute new values
    for i, (x, v) in enumerate(z):
        if (i + 1 >= N):
            break
        x_next = x + h * v
        z[i + 1] = (x_next, v - h * x_next)
    return z
\end{verbatim}

Since energy is now conserved much better, this creates circles in phase space rather than spirals:
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"sphase"}
	\caption{Symplectic Phase $v_0 = 0.0, d_0 = 5.0$: Energy Conserved}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier
 
 \subsection{Symplectic Energy}
Looking at the energy evolution of the Symplectic Euler, we find: 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{"symenergy"}
	\caption{Symplectic Energy $v_0 = 0.0, d_0 = 5.0$: Energy Oscillates}
\end{figure} 
\FloatBarrier

Rather than remaining perfectly constant, the energy oscillates sinusoidally. Unlike the implicit and explicit methods, it does not go
to infinity over time. The maximum energy deviation is about .05\% of the initial total energy, which is a small variation.
